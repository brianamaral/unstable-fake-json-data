# Fake unbalanced json data generator
This is a mock data generator, but instead of generating a fixed schema, some columns may be missing or null.

I created this tool beacausa I work with a lot of json data, and when I want to test some tool, I need the guarantee that the tool supports this kind of schema changes.
